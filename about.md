Hi, my name's <strong>Antonio Molinari</strong>, I'm Italian, and I live near Cremona in the north of Italy with my wife and two children, 11 and 2 years old.

I work mainly with my own agency Incode; we focus on three activities: cms web development, <strong>ruby/rails</strong> or node/js development for custom projects and platforms, UX.
I'm a <strong>web developer and CTO</strong>, I love to write code, but I've to spend a lot of time managing other things :-) I've got different side-projects; I work on blockchain technologies in one of them.

I started being connected and working with digital in the late 90s, so I've seen a lot of tech waves.
I'm here to better understand AI (it's a long time that I have to do it, sincerely), integrate it into my current projects, and maybe new opportunities.

I can help understand feasibility, platforms' architectures and implementation of an idea to be developed or an existing project to be maintained or upgraded. I love (and need) to be updated on exciting things, approaches, and technologies around me, at work, and in life in general. 

I like electronic music, listening, production, and live concerts.

Thanks for reading!
